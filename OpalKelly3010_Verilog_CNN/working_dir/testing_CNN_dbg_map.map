Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    5
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,045 out of  26,624    3%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,710 out of  26,624    6%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,432 out of  13,312   10%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,432 out of   1,432 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,432   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,920 out of  26,624    7%
    Number used as logic:             1,638
    Number used as a route-thru:        210
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:      72
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
