Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:  100
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,091 out of  26,624    4%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,425 out of  26,624    5%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,110 out of  13,312    8%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,110 out of   1,110 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,110   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,566 out of  26,624    5%
    Number used as logic:             1,353

    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:      72
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       4   25%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.39

Peak Memory Usage:  4433 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  9 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   3 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 338 block(s) removed
 148 block(s) optimized away
 338 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
